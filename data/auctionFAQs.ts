    {
        question: 'What is the starting price?',
        answer: "The starting price is the minimum bid amount that users can start bidding with. It sets the initial value for your auction, so make sure it’s an attractive amount that encourages bidding but also reflects the item's worth." 
    },
    {
        question: 'What is the Buy Now price?',
        answer: 'The Buy Now price is an option that allows buyers to purchase the item immediately without waiting for the auction to end. This price should typically be higher than the starting price and reflect the item’s market value or your desired profit margin.'
    },
    {
        question: 'How do I choose the auction length?',
        answer: 'The auction length determines how long your auction will be active. You can select from preset options (e.g., 1 day, 5 days, 10 days) or set a custom duration based on your needs. Consider choosing an auction length that maximizes exposure and increases the chances of attracting bidders.'
    },
    {
        question: 'How do I choose the auction start time?',
        answer: 'You can select an auction start time that best fits your schedule. You have options like starting immediately, in a few hours, or at a custom time in the future. Scheduling your auction start during peak platform usage times may increase visibility and engagement.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Should I use a Reserve Price?',
        answer: 'A reserve price is the minimum amount you’re willing to accept for the item, even if the bidding doesn’t reach that value. This is optional but useful if you want to ensure the item doesn’t sell for less than your expected price. If not met, the auction ends without a winner.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What happens after the auction ends?',
        answer: 'If the auction ends with a winner, you will receive a notification to finalize the transaction. If no bids meet the reserve price (if you set one) or there are no bids, you may have options to relist the item or convert it to a fixed-price listing.'
    },
    {
        question: ' Is there an option to auto-extend the auction if there are last-minute bids?',
        answer: 'Some platforms allow for “anti-sniping” features that automatically extend the auction duration by a few minutes if a bid is placed near the auction’s end. This can be an effective way to maximize bids. If this feature isn’t implemented, you might consider adding it to enhance auction competitiveness.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Can I add images or videos to enhance my auction listing?',
        answer: 'Including multiple images or a video of the item can significantly boost buyer interest and confidence. Consider providing a media upload section that encourages sellers to show different angles or demonstrate the item’s functionality.'
    },

    {
        question: 'Is there a way to promote my auction listing?',
        answer: 'Offering users the ability to feature or promote their auction listing (e.g., highlighting it on the main page or category page) can increase visibility. Providing this option, perhaps as a paid feature, could be beneficial for users looking to maximize their reach.'
