# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a dynamic price range filter system for a Next.js classified app that enables users to filter search results by price ranges. The system will replace the existing hardcoded approach with a sophisticated, scalable solution that dynamically calculates 8 meaningful price ranges based on the actual price distribution of search results. The solution must be performant, cost-efficient, and work across various product types (houses, toys, electronics) with different price scales and currencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user searching for classified items, I want to filter results by price ranges so that I can find items within my budget more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform a search THEN the system SHALL display exactly 8 dynamic price range options based on the actual price distribution of the results
2. WHEN I select one or multiple price ranges THEN the system SHALL filter the results to show only items within the selected ranges
3. WHEN I select a price range THEN the system SHALL update the URL to reflect my selection for shareability
4. WHEN I click "Clear Filter" THEN the system SHALL reset all price range selections and show all results

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user browsing different product categories, I want price ranges that are appropriate for each product type so that the ranges are meaningful and user-friendly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing house listings THEN the system SHALL round price ranges to the nearest R10,000
2. WHEN viewing toy listings THEN the system SHALL round price ranges to the nearest $10
3. WHEN viewing electronics THEN the system SHALL round price ranges to the nearest $100
4. WHEN the price distribution varies significantly THEN the system SHALL use quantiles or clustering to ensure balanced ranges
5. WHEN all items have similar prices THEN the system SHALL create fewer ranges or use smaller increments to avoid empty ranges

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user changing search parameters, I want the price ranges to update dynamically so that they remain relevant to my current search context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change the search location THEN the system SHALL recalculate price ranges based on the new result set
2. WHEN I change the product category THEN the system SHALL recalculate price ranges appropriate for that category
3. WHEN I apply other filters (condition, features) THEN the system SHALL recalculate price ranges for the filtered results
4. WHEN the recalculation occurs THEN the system SHALL complete within 500ms for optimal user experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the price range calculation to be performant and cost-efficient so that server costs remain minimal while providing fast responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating price ranges THEN the system SHALL use server-side computation to minimize client processing
2. WHEN common search queries are performed THEN the system SHALL cache price range calculations to reduce database load
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use aggregation functions (min, max, percentiles) for efficiency
4. WHEN handling large datasets (10,000+ items) THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-500ms response times
5. WHEN serverless functions are used THEN the system SHALL minimize invocations through edge caching

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the price filter interface to be accessible and responsive so that I can use it effectively on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the price filter THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
2. WHEN accessing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for touch interaction
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL announce filter changes and result updates
4. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and readability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user in different regions, I want price ranges displayed in appropriate currencies and formats so that I can understand the pricing in my local context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing house listings in South Africa THEN the system SHALL display prices in ZAR format (R1,000,000)
2. WHEN viewing international listings THEN the system SHALL display prices in USD format ($1,000)
3. WHEN currency formatting is applied THEN the system SHALL use proper locale-specific number formatting
4. IF currency conversion is needed THEN the system SHALL use cached exchange rates to avoid frequent API calls

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want robust error handling and edge case management so that the system remains stable under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no search results are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message instead of price ranges
2. WHEN all items have identical prices THEN the system SHALL create a single range or display a message
3. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL show cached fallback ranges or a loading state
4. WHEN invalid price data exists THEN the system SHALL filter out invalid entries and continue processing
5. WHEN fewer than 8 distinct ranges are possible THEN the system SHALL create the maximum meaningful number of ranges

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want analytics on price range usage so that I can optimize the feature and understand user behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users select price ranges THEN the system SHALL track popular selections for optimization
2. WHEN analytics are collected THEN the system SHALL use lightweight tools to avoid increasing server costs
3. WHEN tracking data is available THEN the system SHALL provide insights for improving default ranges
4. IF analytics show patterns THEN the system SHALL suggest commonly used ranges to users

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user sharing search results, I want the URL to reflect my filter selections so that others can see the same filtered results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select price ranges THEN the system SHALL update the URL with price parameters (e.g., ?price=1000000-1250000)
2. WHEN someone visits a shared URL THEN the system SHALL apply the price filters automatically
3. WHEN the URL contains price parameters THEN the system SHALL validate and apply them correctly
4. WHEN invalid price parameters exist THEN the system SHALL ignore them and show all results

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want comprehensive mock data and test scenarios so that I can verify the system works correctly across different conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing with house data THEN the system SHALL have mock data with prices from R500,000 to R5,000,000
2. WHEN testing with toy data THEN the system SHALL have mock data with prices from $5 to $200
3. WHEN testing with electronics data THEN the system SHALL have mock data with prices from $50 to $5,000
4. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL include datasets with few items, identical prices, and missing prices
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL verify that exactly 8 ranges are generated for normal datasets
6. WHEN testing filtering THEN the system SHALL verify that selected ranges return correct results
