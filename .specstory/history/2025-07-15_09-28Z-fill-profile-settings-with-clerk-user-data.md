# Fill profile settings with Clerk user data (2025-07-15 09:28Z)

_**User (2025-07-15 15:02Z)**_

I want to fill the form in profile-settings with data from the Clerk auths useUser, how can I do that.

---

_**Assistant**_

To pre-fill the form in your `ProfileSettings` component with data from Clerk's `useUser`, you need to:

1. **Extract the relevant user data** from the `user` object returned by `useUser`.
2. **Set the default values** in your `useForm` hook using the `defaultValues` option.
3. **Update the form if the user data loads after the initial render** (since Clerk's user data may be loaded asynchronously).

Here's how you can do it:

---

### 1. Extract Data from Clerk's `user`

Clerk's `user` object typically contains fields like `firstName`, `lastName`, `emailAddress`, `phoneNumber`, etc. You may need to adjust the field names to match your form schema.

### 2. Set Default Values in `useForm`

You can use the `defaultValues` option in `useForm`, and update them when the user data is loaded using `reset` from `react-hook-form`.

### 3. Use `useEffect` to Reset Form When User Data Loads

This ensures the form updates when Clerk finishes loading the user.

---

## Example Implementation

Add the following changes to your component:

```tsx
// ... existing imports ...
import { useEffect } from "react";
// ... existing code ...

const ProfileSettings = () => {
  // ... existing state ...
  const { user, isSignedIn, isLoaded } = useUser();

  // Extract user data for default values
  const defaultValues = {
    name: user?.firstName || "",
    lastName: user?.lastName || "",
    email: user?.emailAddresses?.[0]?.emailAddress || "",
    phone: user?.phoneNumbers?.[0]?.phoneNumber || "",
    // Add other fields as needed
  };

  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors, isSubmitting },
    reset, // <-- add reset
  } = useForm<FormValues>({
    resolver: zodResolver(profileSchema),
    mode: "onChange",
    defaultValues, // <-- set initial default values
  });

  // Update form values when user data is loaded
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isLoaded && user) {
      reset({
        name: user.firstName || "",
        lastName: user.lastName || "",
        email: user.emailAddresses?.[0]?.emailAddress || "",
        phone: user.phoneNumbers?.[0]?.phoneNumber || "",
        // Add other fields as needed
      });
    }
  }, [isLoaded, user, reset]);

  // ... rest of your component ...
};
```

---

### Key Points

- Use `reset` from `react-hook-form` to update the form when user data is available.
- Map Clerk's user fields to your form fields (`name`, `lastName`, `email`, `phone`).
- This approach ensures the form is pre-filled and stays in sync with Clerk's user data.

Let me know if you need help mapping any other specific fields!

_**User (2025-07-15 15:02Z)**_

Look at the code in my whole page at the moment the Input components are empty.

---

_**Assistant**_

The reason your Input components are empty, even though you set `defaultValues` in `useForm`, is because the Clerk `user` data is loaded asynchronously. When your component first renders, `user` is likely `undefined`, so your `defaultValues` are all empty strings. React Hook Form only uses `defaultValues` on the initial mount—if the values change later, the form fields do not update automatically.

**Solution:**  
You need to use the `reset` function from `react-hook-form` to update the form values when the Clerk `user` data becomes available.

---

## How to Fix

1. **Import `useEffect`** from React.
2. **Get `reset` from `useForm`.**
3. **Add a `useEffect` that calls `reset` when `user` is loaded.**

---

### Here’s how to update your code:

```tsx
// ... existing imports ...
import { useEffect } from "react"; // <-- Add this

const ProfileSettings = () => {
  // ... existing state ...
  const { user, isSignedIn, isLoaded } = useUser();

  const defaultValues = {
    name: user?.firstName || "",
    lastName: user?.lastName || "",
    email: user?.emailAddresses?.[0]?.emailAddress || "",
    phone: user?.phoneNumbers?.[0]?.phoneNumber || "",
  };

  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors, isSubmitting },
    reset, // <-- Add this
  } = useForm<FormValues>({
    resolver: zodResolver(profileSchema),
    mode: "onChange",
    defaultValues,
  });

  // Add this effect to update form values when user data loads
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isLoaded && user) {
      reset({
        name: user.firstName || "",
        lastName: user.lastName || "",
        email: user.emailAddresses?.[0]?.emailAddress || "",
        phone: user.phoneNumbers?.[0]?.phoneNumber || "",
      });
    }
  }, [isLoaded, user, reset]);

  // ... rest of your component ...
};
```

---

**Why this works:**  
- `reset` will update all form fields with the new values from Clerk as soon as the user data is loaded.
- This ensures your Input fields are pre-filled as soon as the data is available.

_**User (2025-07-15 15:02Z)**_

I think the issue is with te custom components like Input, I was able to update the Avatar with data from useUser, check the implementation and use of my custom components first. If the issue is not with them then we can look at other potential causes.

---

_**Assistant**_

Great debugging approach! Since your Avatar updates correctly with Clerk data, but your custom Input fields remain empty, let's check how your custom `Input` component is implemented and how it interacts with `react-hook-form`.

### What to Check

1. **Does your Input component support value binding via `defaultValue` or `value`?**
2. **Does it properly forward the `ref` and other props from `register`?**
3. **Is it a controlled or uncontrolled component?**

If your Input component does not forward the `defaultValue` or `value` prop, or does not spread all props from `register`, it will not work with `react-hook-form` as expected.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Show me the code for your custom Input component** (`@/components/Input`).  
2. **Show how you use it in the form** (which you already did).

---

### What I’ll Look For

- Is the Input component spreading all props (`...props`) onto the `<input>` element?
- Is it using `defaultValue` or `value` correctly?
- Is it forwarding the `ref` from `register`?

---

**Please provide the code for your Input component** (or let me know if you want me to locate and read it from your codebase). This will let me give you a precise answer and fix!

---

_**User (2025-07-15 15:02Z)**_

Its the Input component in @/components tell me if you can see it

Your custom `Input` component is **not fully compatible with react-hook-form's uncontrolled mode** because it manages its own internal state (`value`) and always sets the `<input>`'s `value` prop to that state. This makes it a **controlled component**.

### Why This Is a Problem

- **react-hook-form** expects to control the value of the input via the DOM (uncontrolled), unless you explicitly make it a controlled component and synchronize the value.
- When you use `{...register("name")}` with your Input, react-hook-form expects to manage the value, but your Input's internal state (`value`) takes precedence.
- The `value` in your Input is only set from `initialValue` (which is not updated by react-hook-form), and then only updated by typing or suggestion clicks.

### Key Code Section

```tsx
const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
// ...
<input
  // ...
  value={value}
  onChange={handleInternalChange}
  // ...
/>
```

### What Happens

- When you call `reset` in your form, react-hook-form updates the DOM value, but your Input's internal state (`value`) does not update, so the field stays empty.

---

## How to Fix

**Option 1: Make Input Uncontrolled by Default (Recommended for react-hook-form)**

- Remove the `value` prop from the `<input>` unless you want to make it controlled.
- Use `defaultValue` instead, and let react-hook-form manage the value.

**Option 2: Make Input Fully Controlled and Accept `value` and `onChange` from react-hook-form**

- Accept `value` and `onChange` from props (from `register`), and use them as the source of truth.

---

## Minimal Fix Example (Option 2: Controlled)

Update your Input component's `<input>` like this:

```tsx
<input
  // ...
  value={reactHookFormProps?.value ?? value}
  onChange={(e) => {
    reactHookFormProps?.onChange?.(e);
    handleInternalChange(e);
  }}
  ref={ref}
  // ...other props
/>
```

And when you use Input in your form, pass `reactHookFormProps={register("name")}` instead of just `{...register("name")}`.

---

## Minimal Fix Example (Option 1: Uncontrolled)

- Remove the `value` prop from `<input>`.
- Use `defaultValue={initialValue}` or let react-hook-form handle it.

---

## What You Should Do

- **Decide if you want your Input to be controlled or uncontrolled.**
- For react-hook-form, uncontrolled is simpler and more robust.
- If you want to keep your Input controlled, you must synchronize its value with react-hook-form's value.

---

### Next Steps

- Let me know if you want a code snippet for the fix, or if you want to see how to update your usage in the form.
- If you want to keep the Input controlled, I can show you how to wire it up with react-hook-form's `Controller` component.

Would you like a code sample for the fix? And do you want to keep your Input controlled, or make it uncontrolled?

---

_**User (2025-07-15 15:02Z)**_

Give me a code snippet and tell me what has changed

---

_**Assistant**_

Certainly! Here’s a code snippet to make your custom `Input` component compatible with react-hook-form in a **controlled** way, and an explanation of what has changed.

---

## 1. Update the Input Component

**Change:**  
- Use the value and onChange from `reactHookFormProps` (from react-hook-form’s `register`), falling back to internal state only if not provided.
- When using with react-hook-form, pass `reactHookFormProps={register("name")}` instead of `{...register("name")}`.

**Edit the `<input>` in your Input component as follows:**

```tsx
<input
  className={inputClass}
  // Use reactHookFormProps.value if present, else internal value
  value={reactHookFormProps?.value ?? value}
  // Call both reactHookFormProps.onChange and internal handler
  onChange={(e) => {
    reactHookFormProps?.onChange?.(e);
    handleInternalChange(e);
  }}
  // ...other props
  ref={ref}
  // ...rest unchanged
/>
```

---

## 2. Update Usage in Your Form

**Change:**  
- Instead of `{...register("name")}`, use `reactHookFormProps={register("name")}`.

**Example:**

```tsx
<Input
  // ...other props
  reactHookFormProps={register("name")}
  // ...other props
/>
```

---

## What Has Changed

- **Before:**  
  Your Input component always used its own internal state for the value, so react-hook-form could not control or reset the value.
- **After:**  
  The Input component now uses the value and onChange from react-hook-form if provided, so it stays in sync with the form state and updates when you call `reset` or set default values.

---

## Why This Works

- This approach makes your Input a controlled component when used with react-hook-form, ensuring the form state and the input value are always in sync.
- It also preserves your internal state logic for cases where react-hook-form is not used.

_**User (2025-07-15 15:02Z)**_

I have made your changes and this is how I have used Input :
    <Input
            className={`${styles.firstName} ${styles.control}`}
            value={defaultValues.name}
            inputType="text"
            inputSize="large"
            placeholder="First Name"
            label="First Name"
            id="first-name"
            name="first-name"
            ariaLabel="First Name Field"
            autoComplete="on"
            required
            reactHookFormProps={register("name")}
            dashboard
          /> I expect the contents of my Input component to change but they have not. Check my profile-settings code and check my Input implementation and let me know what the issue is.

---

_**Assistant**_

Great, let's debug this step by step based on your usage and the code you provided.

---

## 1. **Your Usage in ProfileSettings**

You are using:
```tsx
<Input
  // ...
  value={defaultValues.name}
  reactHookFormProps={register("name")}
  // ...
/>
```
- `value={defaultValues.name}` is a **static value** set at render time.
- `reactHookFormProps={register("name")}` is correct for passing react-hook-form handlers.

---

## 2. **What’s Happening?**

- The `value` prop you pass (`defaultValues.name`) **never updates** after the initial render, because `defaultValues` is only set once when the component mounts.
- When you call `reset` in a `useEffect`, it updates the form state, but your `<Input value={defaultValues.name} ... />` does **not** update, because `defaultValues.name` does not change after the first render.

---

## 3. **How Should It Work?**

- **With react-hook-form, you should NOT pass a `value` prop** to your Input unless you are fully controlling the value from the form state.
- Instead, let react-hook-form control the value via its internal state and the `register` or `Controller` API.

---

## 4. **What’s the Fix?**

- **Remove the `value` prop** from your Input usage in the form.
- Your Input component should use the value from `reactHookFormProps.value` (which react-hook-form manages) if present.

---

## 5. **Summary of the Fix**

### In your form usage:
```tsx
<Input
  className={`${styles.firstName} ${styles.control}`}
  inputType="text"
  inputSize="large"
  placeholder="First Name"
  label="First Name"
  id="first-name"
  name="first-name"
  ariaLabel="First Name Field"
  autoComplete="on"
  required
  reactHookFormProps={register("name")}
  dashboard
/>
```
**Do NOT pass `value={defaultValues.name}`.**

---

### In your Input component:
Make sure the `<input>` uses:
```tsx
value={reactHookFormProps?.value ?? value}
onChange={(e) => {
  reactHookFormProps?.onChange?.(e);
  handleInternalChange(e);
}}
```
This way, when you call `reset` in your form, react-hook-form will update the value, and your Input will reflect it.

---

## 6. **Why?**

- Passing a `value` prop makes the input controlled by React, and if you don’t update that value, the input will never change.
- react-hook-form expects to control the value itself, so you should let it do so.

---

## 7. **Extra: If You Need to Use Controller**

If your Input is more complex (e.g., for custom value handling), use react-hook-form’s `Controller`:

```tsx
import { Controller } from "react-hook-form";

<Controller
  name="name"
  control={control}
  render={({ field }) => (
    <Input
      // ...other props
      {...field}
      // do NOT pass value or onChange separately
    />
  )}
/>
```

---

## **Summary Table**

| Prop to Input         | Should you use? | Why?                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| value={...}          | ❌ No           | Makes input controlled by React only |
| reactHookFormProps   | ✅ Yes          | Lets RHF manage value/onChange       |
| {...register("name")} (spread) | ✅ Yes (if your Input spreads props to input) | Standard RHF usage |

---

**TL;DR:**  
Remove the `value={defaultValues.name}` prop from your Input usage in the form. Let react-hook-form manage the value via `reactHookFormProps={register("name")}`.
