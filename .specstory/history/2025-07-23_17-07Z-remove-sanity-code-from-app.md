# Remove Sanity code from app (2025-07-23 17:07Z)

_**User**_

I wanted to get started with Sanit from scratch. I want to remove all the Sanity code from my app except for the schemas. Give a break down of what I need to do after you go through my whole codebase.

Here’s a breakdown of what you need to do to remove all Sanity code from your app except for the schemas, based on a scan of your codebase:

---

### 1. **Remove Sanity Packages from Dependencies**
- In both your root `package.json` and `sanity/package.json`, remove all Sanity-related packages except for those needed to define schemas (if you want to keep the Sanity Studio for schema editing, you can keep the `sanity` package in the `/sanity` folder only).
  - Examples: `@sanity/client`, `@sanity/image-url`, `next-sanity`, `@sanity/vision`, `sanity-plugin-asset-source-unsplash`, etc.

---

### 2. **Delete/Refactor All Sanity Client/Utility Code**
- Remove or refactor files that set up or use the Sanity client, such as:
  - `lib/client.ts`
  - `sanity/lib/client.ts`
  - `sanity/sanityClient.ts`
  - `sanity/lib/image.ts`
  - `sanity/lib/live.ts`
  - `sanity/config/client-config.ts`
- Remove any custom hooks, utilities, or server actions that use Sanity for data fetching or mutations.

---

### 3. **Remove Sanity Actions and API Usage**
- Delete or refactor all files in `sanity/actions/` that use the Sanity client, such as:
  - `createAd.ts`
  - `createTransaction.ts`
- Remove any usage of Sanity in your API routes, e.g.:
  - `app/api/paystack/ThankYou.tsx` (uses `@sanity/client`)

---

### 4. **Remove Sanity Studio Integration from the App**
- Remove any code that integrates Sanity Studio into your Next.js app, such as:
  - `app/admin/[[...index]]/page.tsx` (uses `NextStudio` from `next-sanity/studio`)
  - Any references to `sanity.config` or `sanity/sanity.config.ts` in your app code

---

### 5. **Remove Sanity Imports from App Code**
- Search for and remove all imports from:
  - `@sanity/client`
  - `next-sanity`
  - `@sanity/image-url`
  - Any other Sanity-related packages in your app code (outside `/sanity/schemas`)

---

### 6. **Keep Only the Schema Files**
- Retain only the schema files in `/sanity/schemas/` and their dependencies (e.g., Zod types, schema objects).
- You can keep the `/sanity` folder for schema development, but it should not be referenced by your main app code.

---

### 7. **Update Environment Variables**
- Remove any Sanity-related environment variables from your `.env` files if they are no longer needed.

---

### 8. **Test Your App**
- Run your app and ensure there are no references to Sanity in the runtime or build output.
- Make sure all data fetching, mutations, and admin interfaces are now handled by your new backend or CMS.

---

### 9. **(Optional) Keep Sanity Studio for Schema Editing**
- If you want to keep using Sanity Studio for schema editing, you can keep the `/sanity` folder and run the studio separately (`cd sanity && sanity dev`).
- The main app should not import or use any code from `/sanity` except for the schemas if you want to keep them as TypeScript types.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Keep                | Remove/Refactor                |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| `/sanity/schemas/`  | All Sanity client code        |
| `/sanity/schemas/*` | All Sanity actions            |
| `/sanity` (optional for Studio) | All Sanity API usage in app |
|                     | All Sanity imports in app     |
|                     | Sanity Studio integration in app |
|                     | Sanity env variables (if unused) |

Would you like a step-by-step checklist or help with the actual code changes for any of these steps?

---

_**User**_

I have backedup my schema in a folder called schemaArchives in the root of my app now the whole sanity folder can be removed.

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Since you have backed up your schemas in `schemaArchives` and no longer need the `/sanity` folder, here’s what you should do next:

---

## **Steps to Completely Remove Sanity from Your App**

### 1. **Delete the Entire `/sanity` Folder**
- You can safely delete the entire `/sanity` directory from your project root.

### 2. **Remove Sanity-Related Packages**
- Open your root `package.json` and remove all Sanity-related dependencies:
  - `@sanity/client`
  - `@sanity/image-url`
  - `@sanity/vision`
  - `sanity`
  - `sanity-plugin-asset-source-unsplash`
  - `next-sanity`
  - Any other Sanity-related packages
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to update your `node_modules`.

### 3. **Remove Sanity Imports and Usages in App Code**
- Search your entire codebase for any imports or usage of:
  - `@sanity/client`
  - `@sanity/image-url`
  - `next-sanity`
  - Any other Sanity-related code
- Remove or refactor any code that uses these imports.

### 4. **Remove Sanity Studio Integration**
- Delete any files/pages that integrate Sanity Studio into your app, such as:
  - `app/admin/[[...index]]/page.tsx`
  - Any references to `sanity.config` or similar

### 5. **Remove Sanity-Related Environment Variables**
- Open your `.env` files and remove any variables related to Sanity (e.g., `SANITY_PROJECT_ID`, `SANITY_DATASET`, `SANITY_SECRET_TOKEN`).

### 6. **Test Your App**
- Run your app and ensure there are no errors or missing module issues related to Sanity.

---

## **Summary**

- [x] Backup schemas to `schemaArchives`
- [ ] Delete `/sanity` folder
- [ ] Remove Sanity packages from `package.json`
- [ ] Remove all Sanity imports/usages in app code
- [ ] Remove Sanity Studio integration
- [ ] Remove Sanity environment variables
- [ ] Test the app

---

If you want, I can help you identify the exact files and lines to delete or refactor in your app code. Would you like a list of all files outside `/sanity` that reference Sanity, or do you want to proceed with the above checklist?

---

_**User**_

Now remove all Sanity code for me but leave the schema files I have backed up inside sanityArchive folder

---

_**Assistant**_

Could not find file sanity in the workspace.
