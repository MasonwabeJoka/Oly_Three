The error `ReferenceError: setSelectedItems is not defined` means that somewhere in your code (or a component you use), there is a call to `setSelectedItems`, but this function is not defined in the current scope.

**In your attached file (`page.tsx`), there is no reference to `setSelectedItems` at all.**  
However, the error stack trace points to a function called `clearInputAndSuggestions`, which is likely inside a component you are using—most probably your custom `Input` or `Select` component, since those are the only places where "selected items" would make sense.

### Why this happens:
- If you have a custom `Input` or `Select` component that supports multi-select or suggestions, it may try to call `setSelectedItems` (for example, when clearing the input or suggestions).
- If you use such a component in single-select mode, but the component still tries to call `setSelectedItems` (which is not passed as a prop), you get this error.

### How to fix:
1. **Check your `Input` and `Select` components** (in `@/components/Input` and `@/components/Select`):
   - Look for any usage of `setSelectedItems` inside those components.
   - Make sure that if `setSelectedItems` is called, it is only called if it is actually passed as a prop (i.e., check if it is defined before calling).
   - If you are not using multi-select, ensure the component does not expect or require `setSelectedItems`.

2. **If you are using a third-party component** (unlikely, since your project uses custom UI), check its documentation for required props.

---

#### Example Fix (in your Input/Select component):

```js
// Before
function clearInputAndSuggestions() {
  setInputValue("");
  setSuggestions([]);
  setSelectedItems([]); // <-- This line causes error if setSelectedItems is not defined
}

// After
function clearInputAndSuggestions() {
  setInputValue("");
  setSuggestions([]);
  if (typeof setSelectedItems === "function") {
    setSelectedItems([]);
  }
}
```

---

**Summary:**  
- The error is not in your `page.tsx` file, but in a component you use (likely `Input` or `Select`).
- You need to make sure `setSelectedItems` is only called if it is defined.
- Update your custom component(s) accordingly.

Would you like me to locate and patch the exact place in your `Input` or `Select` component where this happens?

Fix ReferenceError by ensuring setSelectedItems is only called if it is defined. In clearInputAndSuggestions, check if setSelectedItems exists before calling it. This prevents errors when Input is used in single-select mode, as in HeroSectionSearch and HeroSectionSearchClient.

The root cause of your `ReferenceError: setSelectedItems is not defined` was in your custom `Input` component. The function `clearInputAndSuggestions` was calling `setSelectedItems([])` directly, but `setSelectedItems` is not always defined—especially when the component is used in single-select mode (as in your HeroSectionSearch and HeroSectionSearchClient).

**Fix applied:**  
- The code now checks if `onSelectedItemsChange` (the prop that updates selected items) is a function before calling it.  
- This prevents the ReferenceError in all usages, including your HeroSectionSearch and HeroSectionSearchClient.

You should now be able to use your search and input fields without encountering this error. If you have further issues or want to check other related components, let me know!

HeroSectionSearchClient has Input custom components that have search suggestions when I select a suggestion the text of the suggestion is not updating the field. Why is that and how can it be changed. I would like the change to be done to the Input component.

The reason why selecting a suggestion in your custom `Input` component does **not** update the visible value in the field is because the component is **fully controlled** by the `value` prop, which is managed by the parent (e.g., via `react-hook-form`'s `register`). When you click a suggestion, the `handleSuggestionClick` function fires and calls `onChange` with a synthetic event, but if the parent does not immediately update the `value` prop in response, the input's visible value does not change.

### Why this happens:
- The `Input` component's `<input>` field uses the `value` prop.
- When a suggestion is clicked, `onChange` is called with the suggestion as the new value.
- If the parent (e.g., `react-hook-form`) does not update the value prop in response to this synthetic event, the input's value remains unchanged.

### How to fix:
- **Update the Input component to also update its own internal state for the value when a suggestion is clicked, if it is being used as a controlled component.**
- This can be done by adding a local state for the value, syncing it with the prop, and updating it on suggestion click.

#### The best practice:
- For a controlled input, the parent should update the value prop in response to `onChange`.
- However, for compatibility and to ensure the UI updates instantly, you can add a local state fallback that updates on suggestion click.

## Solution: Update the Input component

- Add a local state for the value.
- Sync it with the value prop.
- Update the local value when a suggestion is clicked.

I'll make this change now.

Make Input component update its own local value state when a suggestion is clicked, so the field updates visually even if the parent (e.g., react-hook-form) does not immediately update the value prop. This ensures that selecting a suggestion always updates the input field.

The Input component has been updated so that when you select a suggestion, the input field's value is immediately updated visually—even if the parent (such as react-hook-form) does not update the value prop right away. This is achieved by maintaining an internal value state that syncs with the prop and updates on suggestion click.

Now, when you select a suggestion in HeroSectionSearchClient (or anywhere else), the field will always show the selected suggestion as its value.

If you need further tweaks or want to test this in a specific context, let me know!

Fix the right icon logic so that after clearing the input, the clear (X) icon disappears and the search icon (or provided iconSrcRight) is shown if the input is empty. The icon should depend on internalValue, not the value prop, for correct reactivity.

The Input component now uses the actual input value (`internalValue`) to determine which icon to show. After clearing the input, the clear (X) icon will disappear and the search icon (or your provided iconSrcRight) will be shown if the input is empty, as expected for a search input.
