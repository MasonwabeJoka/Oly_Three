# Troubleshoot ShowMenu error handling (2025-07-10 12:40Z)

_**User**_

I have a test error in ShowMenu.tsx and a global-error file in the app folder, if doesn't look like globla-error.tsx is rendering the error in ShowMenu as it should. What is the issue?

_**Assistant**_

To diagnose why your global error handler (likely `global-error.tsx`) is not rendering errors from `ShowMenu.tsx`, let's walk through the likely causes and what to check:

### 1. File Naming and Placement
- In Next.js 13+ (app directory), the global error boundary must be named **`error.tsx`** (not `global-error.tsx`) and placed at the root of the `app` directory or inside a route segment.
- If your file is named `global-error.tsx`, it will **not** be picked up by Next.js as the error boundary.

**Solution:**  
Rename `global-error.tsx` to `error.tsx` and ensure it is in the correct directory (e.g., `/app/error.tsx`).

---

### 2. Error Propagation
- For the error boundary to catch errors, the error must be thrown during rendering, in a server component, or in a client component's lifecycle.
- If `ShowMenu.tsx` is a client component and the error is caught internally (e.g., with a try/catch), it will not propagate to the error boundary.

**Solution:**  
Ensure that errors in `ShowMenu.tsx` are not being caught and handled internally if you want the global error boundary to catch them.

---

### 3. Correct Usage in the App Directory
- The error boundary will only catch errors in the subtree where it is defined. If you want a global error handler, it should be at `/app/error.tsx`.

---

### 4. Testing the Error Boundary
- To test, you can throw an error in `ShowMenu.tsx`'s render method or useEffect and see if the error boundary renders.

---

### What to Do Next

1. **Check your file name and location:**  
   - Should be `/app/error.tsx`.

2. **Check your error handling in `ShowMenu.tsx`:**  
   - Make sure errors are not being caught and handled inside the component.

3. **Test with a forced error:**  
   - Temporarily add `throw new Error("Test error")` in `ShowMenu.tsx` to see if the error boundary is triggered.

---

If you want, I can check your `global-error.tsx` and `ShowMenu.tsx` files for you. Please let me know if you want to proceed with that, or if you want to rename the file and test as described above!
