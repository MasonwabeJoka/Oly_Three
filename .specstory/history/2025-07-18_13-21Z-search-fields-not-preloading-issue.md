# Search fields not preloading issue (2025-07-18 13:21Z)

_**User (2025-07-18 13:21Z)**_

My HeroSectionSearch fields are not preloading with searchParams values

---

_**Assistant**_

The issue is that your form fields in `HeroSectionSearchClient` are not preloading with the values from `searchParams`. Let's analyze why this is happening:

### Key Points in Your Code

- You are using `react-hook-form` with `defaultValues` set from `searchParams`:
  ```ts
  defaultValues: {
    searchTerm: searchParams.searchTerm || "afadsf",
    locationSearch: searchParams.locationSearch || "afadsf",
  }
  ```
- However, `react-hook-form`'s `defaultValues` are only set on the initial mount. If `searchParams` changes after the component mounts, the form will not update unless you call `reset()` with the new values.

### Why the fields are not preloading

- If `searchParams` is undefined or empty on the first render, the form will use the fallback `"afadsf"`.
- If `searchParams` is set after the component mounts (e.g., via navigation or prop update), the form will not update its values automatically.

### Solution

You need to watch for changes in `searchParams` and call `reset()` with the new values when they change.

#### How to Fix

Add a `useEffect` that listens for changes in `searchParams` and calls `reset()`:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
// ... existing imports

const HeroSectionSearchClient = ({ searchParams = {} }: HeroSectionSearchClientProps) => {
  // ... existing code

  useEffect(() => {
    reset({
      searchTerm: searchParams.searchTerm || "",
      locationSearch: searchParams.locationSearch || "",
    });
  }, [searchParams, reset]);

  // ... existing code
};
```

- This ensures that whenever `searchParams` changes, the form fields are updated accordingly.

I've added a `useEffect` to your `HeroSectionSearchClient` component so that the form fields will now preload and update with the correct values from `searchParams` whenever they change. This should resolve the issue with the fields not preloading as expected.

_**User (2025-07-18 13:21Z)**_

this did not work. My fields are still not prefilled http://localhost:3000/?searchTerm=phone&locationSearch=Tokyo

---

_**Assistant**_

Thank you for the update and the URL example. If the fields are still not prefilled, let's troubleshoot further:

### 1. Are `searchParams` being passed correctly?
- In Next.js App Router, `searchParams` are typically passed to server components, not client components.
- In your client component, you are using a prop `searchParams`, but unless the parent (likely a server component) is explicitly passing these props, they will be empty.

### 2. How are you rendering `HeroSectionSearchClient`?
- If you are using this component directly in a page or another component, you need to ensure that the parent is extracting the search params and passing them down.

#### Example: Correct usage in a server component
```tsx
// In your page.tsx or a server component
import HeroSectionSearchClient from "@/components/HeroSectionSearchClient";

export default function Page({ searchParams }) {
  return <HeroSectionSearchClient searchParams={searchParams} />;
}
```
- Here, `searchParams` is provided by Next.js App Router to server components.

### 3. In the client component, `useSearchParams` is not used for default values
- You are using `useSearchParams` but only for navigation, not for initial values.

---

## What to do

1. **Check the parent component:**  
   Ensure that `HeroSectionSearchClient` is being rendered by a server component that passes `searchParams` as a prop.

2. **Alternative: Use `useSearchParams` directly in the client component**  
   If you want the client component to read the URL params itself, you can use the `useSearchParams` hook from `next/navigation`:

   ```tsx
   import { useSearchParams } from "next/navigation";

   const searchParams = useSearchParams();
   const searchTerm = searchParams.get("searchTerm") || "";
   const locationSearch = searchParams.get("locationSearch") || "";

   useEffect(() => {
     reset({
       searchTerm,
       locationSearch,
     });
   }, [searchTerm, locationSearch, reset]);
   ```

---

## Next Steps

Would you like me to update your component to use `useSearchParams` directly for pre-filling the form fields? This will ensure the fields always reflect the current URL, regardless of how the component is rendered.

_**User (2025-07-18 13:21Z)**_

Also check if the code in HeroSection is implemented correctly. This does not work yet.

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's review your `HeroSection` implementation and how it passes `searchParams`:

### Your Current Code

```tsx
interface HeroSectionProps {
  category: "all" | "property" | "vehicles" | "services" | "jobs" | "shops";
  mainTitle?: string;
  searchParams?: { searchTerm?: string; locationSearch?: string };
}

const HeroSection = ({ category, mainTitle, searchParams = {} }: HeroSectionProps) => {
  // ...
  return (
    // ...
    <div className={styles.heroSectionSearchContainer}>
      {category === "all" && <HeroSectionSearch searchParams={searchParams} />}
      {category === "property" && <PropertiesHeroSectionSearch />}
      {category === "shops" && <ShopsHeroSectionSearch />}
    </div>
    // ...
  );
};
```

### Key Points

- You are passing `searchParams` as a prop to `HeroSectionSearch`.
- But, for this to work, the parent of `HeroSection` (likely a page or layout file) must receive `searchParams` from Next.js and pass it down.

### Common Issue

In Next.js App Router, only server components (like `page.tsx`) automatically receive `searchParams` as a prop. If `HeroSection` is not used directly in a server component, or if its parent does not pass `searchParams`, it will always be `{}`.

#### Example of correct usage in a page:

```tsx
// app/page.tsx or app/(some-segment)/page.tsx
import HeroSection from "@/components/HeroSection";

export default function Page({ searchParams }) {
  return <HeroSection category="all" searchParams={searchParams} />;
}
```

- Here, `searchParams` is provided by Next.js and passed down to `HeroSection`, which then passes it to `HeroSectionSearch`.

---

## What to Check and Fix

1. **Is `HeroSection` used in a server component that receives and passes `searchParams`?**
   - If not, update the parent to do so.

2. **If you want to support client-side reading of search params, you can remove the `searchParams` prop entirely and let the search component use `useSearchParams` (as you now do in `HeroSectionSearchClient`).**

---

## Recommendation

- If you want to keep the prop-based approach, ensure every parent in the chain passes `searchParams` down from the page component.
- If you want to simplify, remove the `searchParams` prop and let the search component always use `useSearchParams` directly.

---

### Would you like me to:
- Show you how to update your page component to pass `searchParams` down to `HeroSection`?
- Or refactor `HeroSectionSearch` to not require the `searchParams` prop at all (recommended for simplicity)?

Let me know your preference!

Here’s what’s happening and why your fields are not prefilled:

---

### 1. **Input Component is Controlled Internally**
- Your `Input` component maintains its own internal state:  
  ```js
  const [internalValue, setInternalValue] = useState(value);
  ```
- It sets the `<input>`'s value to `internalValue`, not the value from react-hook-form.
- The only way the value updates is if the `value` prop changes, but when using `register` from react-hook-form, you do **not** pass a `value` prop.

---

### 2. **How React Hook Form Works**
- With react-hook-form, you use `{...register("fieldName")}` on the input, and **do not** set the `value` prop directly.
- React Hook Form expects the input to be "uncontrolled" (i.e., the DOM manages its value, not React state).

---

### 3. **Why This Breaks Prefilling**
- Because your `Input` is always controlled by its own `internalValue` state, and not by react-hook-form, the value from the form's state (including default values and resets) is ignored after the first render.
- This means the field will not update when you call `reset` or when the form's default values change.

---

## **How to Fix**

You have two options:

### **Option 1: Make Input Fully Controlled by React Hook Form**
- Pass the `value` and `onChange` from react-hook-form to your `Input` component.
- In `HeroSectionSearchClient`, use `control` and `Controller` from react-hook-form for each field.

#### Example for one field:
```tsx
import { Controller } from "react-hook-form";

// In your form JSX:
<Controller
  name="searchTerm"
  control={control}
  render={({ field }) => (
    <Input
      {...field}
      // ...other props
      // Remove {...register("searchTerm")}
    />
  )}
/>
```
- Do the same for `locationSearch`.

### **Option 2: Make Input Uncontrolled**
- Remove all internal state (`internalValue`, `setInternalValue`, etc.) from your `Input` component.
- Let the DOM manage the value, and let react-hook-form handle everything via `register`.

---

## **Recommendation**

**Option 1** is the most robust and compatible with your current Input design.

Would you like me to update your `HeroSectionSearchClient` to use `Controller` for both fields and show you the necessary changes?

Your `HeroSectionSearchClient` form is now using react-hook-form's `Controller` for both the `searchTerm` and `locationSearch` fields. This makes the `Input` component fully controlled by react-hook-form, ensuring that prefilled values from the URL (or any default/reset) will now appear in the fields as expected.

You should now see the fields prefilled when you visit a URL like:
```
http://localhost:3000/?searchTerm=phone&locationSearch=Tokyo
```

Let me know if the fields are now prefilled, or if you need any further help!

No, it is **not advisable** to use `searchParams` from the URL for a profile settings form like you did for the search form. Here’s why:

---

### 1. **Profile Data Should Come from the User’s Account, Not the URL**
- Profile settings (name, email, phone, etc.) are user-specific and should be loaded from your authentication/user management system (e.g., Clerk, Firebase, your backend).
- The URL’s query parameters (`searchParams`) are meant for things like search filters, navigation state, or sharing a specific view—not for sensitive or persistent user data.

---

### 2. **Security and Consistency**
- Allowing profile data to be set via URL parameters could be a security risk (e.g., someone could craft a URL to prefill someone else’s data).
- It could also lead to inconsistent or unexpected behavior if the URL is manipulated.

---

### 3. **Best Practice**
- Always load profile form defaults from the authenticated user’s data (as you are doing with Clerk’s `user` object and `reset(defaultValues)` in your `useEffect`).
- Only use `searchParams` for things that are meant to be shareable or navigational (like search filters, pagination, etc.).

---

### 4. **Your Current Approach is Correct**
- Your current `ProfileSettings` form loads the user’s data from Clerk and sets it as the form’s default values. This is the correct and secure approach.

---

**Summary:**  
- Use `searchParams` for search/filter/navigation state.
- Use user/account data for profile forms.

If you have a specific use case in mind for using `searchParams` in a profile form, let me know and I can advise on a safe approach!

When the fields in heroSectionSearch are filled and the Search button is clicked I want to be taken to /listings where I will see the search results. In this page are corresponding fiels searchTerm and locationSearch I want theeir code updated to have the same functionality as the HeroSearchClient code. I want you to create the right approach to accomplish this. Though the backend code is not implemented yet.

---

_**Assistant**_

Here’s a robust approach to achieve your requirements, matching the search experience in `HeroSectionSearchClient` and ensuring the search fields on `/listings` are in sync with the URL and each other:

---

## 1. **How it should work**

- When a user fills the search fields in the hero section and clicks "Search", they are navigated to `/listings?searchTerm=...&locationSearch=...`.
- On the `/listings` page, the search fields at the top are prefilled from the URL query params and can be edited.
- Submitting the search form on `/listings` updates the URL and (eventually) triggers a backend search.

---

## 2. **How to implement**

### **A. HeroSectionSearchClient**

- You already have this working: it updates the URL and navigates to `/` (or you can change it to `/listings`).

**Change this line:**
```ts
router.push(`/?${params.toString()}`);
```
**To:**
```ts
router.push(`/listings?${params.toString()}`);
```

---

### **B. Listings Page Search Bar**

- Create a `ListingsSearchClient` component that:
  - Uses `useSearchParams` to get `searchTerm` and `locationSearch` from the URL.
  - Uses `react-hook-form` with `Controller` for both fields, just like `HeroSectionSearchClient`.
  - On submit, updates the URL (using `router.push`) with the new search params, so the page can react to changes and (eventually) fetch new results.

---

### **C. Example: ListingsSearchClient.tsx**

```tsx
"use client";
import { useForm, Controller } from "react-hook-form";
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
import { searchFormSchema } from "@/lib/validations/formValidations";
import { z } from "zod";
import { useRouter, useSearchParams } from "next/navigation";
import Input from "@/components/Input";
import Button from "@/components/Buttons";
import { suggestions } from "@/data/SuggestionsData";
import styles from "./ListingsSearchClient.module.scss"; // create as needed

type FormValues = z.infer<typeof searchFormSchema>;

const ListingsSearchClient = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();

  const searchTerm = searchParams.get("searchTerm") || "";
  const locationSearch = searchParams.get("locationSearch") || "";

  const {
    handleSubmit,
    setError,
    reset,
    formState: { errors, isSubmitting },
    control,
  } = useForm<FormValues>({
    resolver: zodResolver(searchFormSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      searchTerm,
      locationSearch,
    },
  });

  // Keep form in sync with URL
  useEffect(() => {
    reset({
      searchTerm,
      locationSearch,
    });
  }, [searchTerm, locationSearch, reset]);

  const onSubmit = (data: FormValues) => {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString());
    params.set("searchTerm", data.searchTerm);
    params.set("locationSearch", data.locationSearch);
    router.push(`/listings?${params.toString()}`);
    // (eventually: trigger backend search here)
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className={styles.searchFields}>
      <Controller
        name="searchTerm"
        control={control}
        render={({ field }) => (
          <Input
            {...field}
            className={styles.searchTermInput}
            isSearchBar={true}
            suggestions={suggestions}
            inputType="text"
            inputSize="large"
            label="Search"
            placeholder="What are you looking for?"
            id="searchTerm"
            error={errors.searchTerm?.message}
            ariaLabel="Search Term"
            autoComplete="off"
            required
          />
        )}
      />
      <Controller
        name="locationSearch"
        control={control}
        render={({ field }) => (
          <Input
            {...field}
            className={styles.searchLocationInput}
            isSearchBar={true}
            suggestions={suggestions}
            inputType="text"
            inputSize="large"
            label="Location"
            placeholder="Search by city, province, township..."
            id="locationSearch"
            error={errors.locationSearch?.message}
            ariaLabel="Location"
            autoComplete="off"
            required
          />
        )}
      />
      <Button
        buttonChildren="Search"
        className={styles.search}
        buttonType="normal"
        buttonSize="large"
        name="Search Button"
        type="submit"
        ariaLabel="Search Button"
        autoFocus={false}
        disabled={isSubmitting}
      />
    </form>
  );
};

export default ListingsSearchClient;
```

---

### **D. Use ListingsSearchClient in ListingsClient**

- At the top of your `ListingsClient` component (or wherever you want the search bar), render `<ListingsSearchClient />`.

---

### **E. Summary of Flow**

1. User searches in hero section → navigates to `/listings?searchTerm=...&locationSearch=...`
2. `/listings` page search bar is prefilled from URL, and can be edited.
3. Submitting the search bar updates the URL and (eventually) triggers a new search.

---

Would you like me to create the `ListingsSearchClient.tsx` file and show you how to integrate it into your `/listings` page?

Your `ListingsSearchForm` implementation is **very close to correct** and follows the right approach for syncing form state with the URL and providing a robust search experience. Here’s a review and a couple of small recommendations:

---

## ✅ What You Did Right

- **Uses `react-hook-form` with `Controller`** for both `searchTerm` and `locationSearch`, so the fields are controlled and compatible with your custom `Input`.
- **Prefills fields from the URL** using `useSearchParams` and `reset` in a `useEffect`, so the form always reflects the current URL state.
- **On submit, updates the URL** with the new search parameters using `router.push`, which is the correct way to trigger a new search and update the page.
- **Error handling** is in place for form validation.
- **UI/UX**: You have categories, breadcrumbs, and a search button, which is a nice touch.

---

## 🟡 Minor Issues / Recommendations

1. **Form Tag**
   - You are using `<Form>` from `next/form`, which is not standard and may not work as expected for client-side forms.  
   - **Recommendation:** Use a regular `<form>` tag for client-side forms with react-hook-form.

   ```tsx
   // Change this:
   import Form from "next/form";
   // ...
   <Form ...> ... </Form>

   // To this:
   <form ...> ... </form>
   ```

   And update the closing tag as well.

2. **onSubmit Handler**
   - You have commented out the `onSubmit` handler on the form, so the form will not actually trigger your custom logic.
   - **Recommendation:** Uncomment and use the handler:

   ```tsx
   <form
     action="/search"
     id="Listings Search"
     className={styles.searchContainer}
     onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit, onError)}
     noValidate
   >
   ```

   - You can remove the `action` attribute if you are handling everything client-side.

3. **Optional: Remove Unused Prop**
   - The `onSubmit` prop in your `ListingsSearchFormProps` interface is not used and can be removed.

---

## 🟢 Summary

- Your logic for syncing with the URL and using react-hook-form is correct.
- Just switch to a regular `<form>` and make sure your `onSubmit` handler is active.

---

### **Would you like me to make these small fixes for you?**

---

_**User (2025-07-18 13:21Z)**_

I would rather use the next js Form, isn't that better?

---

_**Assistant**_

Using the `<Form>` component from `next/form` is only beneficial if you are leveraging Next.js’s new **Server Actions** (introduced in Next.js 13+), which allow you to run form submissions directly on the server without writing an API route. This is a powerful feature for server-side mutations, but it comes with important caveats:

---

## When to Use `<Form>` from `next/form`

- **You want to use Server Actions:**  
  You want your form submission to be handled by a server action function (e.g., `async function action(formData) { ... }`), and you want the form to work with progressive enhancement (JS or no JS).
- **You do NOT need client-side validation or interactivity:**  
  Server Actions are best for simple forms where you don’t need advanced client-side validation, dynamic field updates, or custom error handling in the browser.

---

## When **NOT** to Use `<Form>` from `next/form`

- **You want full client-side control:**  
  If you are using `react-hook-form` for validation, error handling, and controlled components, you should use a regular `<form>` and handle submission with `onSubmit`.
- **You want to update the URL or state on the client:**  
  If you want to update the URL with `router.push` or do anything else client-side after submit, you need a regular `<form>`.

---

## Your Use Case

- You are using `react-hook-form` for client-side validation and want to update the URL with `router.push` on submit.
- You are not using a server action as your form’s action handler.

**→ In this case, you should use a regular `<form>`.**

---

## Summary Table

| Use Case                        | Use `<Form>` from `next/form` | Use regular `<form>` |
|----------------------------------|:-----------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Server Actions (server-side)     | ✅                            |                      |
| Client-side validation/logic     |                               | ✅                   |
| Update URL with router           |                               | ✅                   |
| Use react-hook-form              |                               | ✅                   |
| Works without JS (progressive)   | ✅                            |                      |

---

## Final Recommendation

- **For your current setup (react-hook-form, client-side validation, router.push):**  
  **Use a regular `<form>`.**
- If you want to migrate to server actions in the future, you can revisit using `<Form>`.

---

If you want, I can update your code to use a regular `<form>` and ensure everything works as intended!
