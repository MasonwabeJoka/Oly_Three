The error you're seeing:

```
Error: Cannot render <noscript> outside the main document. Try moving it into the root <head> tag.
```

is a known issue when using Sanity Studio (via `next-sanity`'s `NextStudio` component) inside a Next.js app directory project, especially when the Studio is rendered within the app's main layout. This happens because Sanity Studio (or one of its dependencies) tries to render a `<noscript>` tag, which Next.js only allows inside the `<head>` of the root document, not in nested layouts or pages.

**Why this happens:**
- In Next.js App Router, all routes (including `/studio`) inherit the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`), which often includes your site's navigation, footers, and other wrappers.
- Sanity Studio expects to be rendered in a minimal, "bare" environment, not inside your site's main layout.

---

## **How to Fix**

### 1. **Separate the Studio Route from Your Main Layout**

You need to ensure that the Studio route does **not** inherit your main app layout. This is done by:
- Placing the Studio route in its own route group (e.g., `(studio)`).
- Giving it its own minimal `layout.tsx` that does **not** include your site's navigation, footers, or other wrappers.

**Example structure:**

```
app/
  (studio)/
    studio/
      layout.tsx   <-- minimal layout for studio
      [[...tool]]/
        page.tsx   <-- your current NextStudio page
  (root)/
    layout.tsx     <-- your main site layout
    ...
```

**Minimal `app/(studio)/studio/layout.tsx`:**
```tsx
export default function StudioLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
- This layout does **not** include your site's navigation, footers, or any other wrappers.
- It only wraps the Studio in a bare `<html>` and `<body>`.

### 2. **Update Your Studio Route**

Move your current `app/studio/[[...tool]]/page.tsx` into `app/(studio)/studio/[[...tool]]/page.tsx` if it's not already there.

---

## **Summary of Steps**

1. **Create a new route group for Studio:**  
   - `app/(studio)/studio/layout.tsx` (minimal layout)
   - `app/(studio)/studio/[[...tool]]/page.tsx` (your Studio page)

2. **Ensure your main app layout is only used for your main site, not for Studio.**

The minimal Studio layout file has been created at `app/studio/layout.tsx`. It wraps the Studio route in a bare `<html>` and `<body>`, with no navigation or footers.

**If you still see a linter error:**  
- Make sure there are no stray characters or whitespace before the `export` statement in the file.
- The file should start directly with the comment or the export statement.

You can now use this minimal layout for your Studio route. This should resolve the `<noscript>` error when rendering Sanity Studio in your Next.js app.

If you need to move your Studio route into a route group (e.g., `(studio)/studio/`), let me know and I can guide you through that as well!

Error: A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

_**Assistant**_

This new error is a **hydration mismatch** between the server-rendered HTML and what React expects on the client. This is common when using Sanity Studio (or other complex React apps) inside Next.js App Router, especially if:

- The Studio is rendered as a Client Component, but the layout or parent is a Server Component.
- There are mismatches in how styles or dynamic values are generated between server and client.
- The Studio is not fully isolated from your main app's context.

### Why this happens with Sanity Studio

Sanity Studio is a **fully client-side React app**. It expects to control its own rendering, theming, and sometimes even its own `<html>` and `<body>` tags. If you render it inside a Next.js App Router route, you must ensure:

- The layout is as minimal as possible (which you did).
- The Studio page is a **Client Component** (`'use client'` at the top).
- No server-only logic or context leaks into the Studio.
- No dynamic values (like `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, or browser-only APIs) are used in the layout or page unless properly handled.

---

## **How to Fix Hydration Mismatch for Sanity Studio in Next.js App Router**

### 1. **Ensure the Studio Page is a Client Component**

Your `app/studio/[[...tool]]/page.tsx` should start with:

```tsx
'use client';
```

This ensures everything inside is rendered on the client, matching what Sanity Studio expects.

### 2. **Minimal Layout**

Your `app/studio/layout.tsx` is already minimal, which is good.

### 3. **No Server/Client Branching in Studio Layout**

Do **not** use any `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')` or similar logic in the Studio layout or page.

### 4. **No Dynamic Values in Layout**

Do **not** use `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, or any value that changes between server and client in the layout or Studio page.

### 5. **No Styled Components Registry or Providers in Studio Layout**

If you use styled-components or other providers in your main app, **do not** include them in the Studio layout. Sanity Studio manages its own styles.

---

## **Example: Correct Studio Setup**

**app/studio/layout.tsx**
```tsx
// Minimal layout for Sanity Studio
export default function StudioLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

**app/studio/[[...tool]]/page.tsx**
```tsx
'use client';

import { NextStudio } from 'next-sanity/studio';
import config from '../../../sanity.config';

export default function StudioPage() {
  return <NextStudio config={config} />;
}
```

---

## **If You Still Get Hydration Mismatches**

- **Clear `.next` and restart your dev server**:  
  Sometimes old builds cause mismatches.
  ```
  rm -rf .next
  npm run dev
  ```
- **Check for browser extensions**:  
  Some extensions (like ad blockers or dark mode injectors) can modify the DOM before React hydrates, causing mismatches.
- **Check for custom fonts or CSS-in-JS**:  
  If you use custom fonts or CSS-in-JS in your main app, make sure they are not included in the Studio layout.

---

## **Summary**

- Studio layout: minimal, no dynamic values, no providers.
- Studio page: `'use client'` at the top.
- No server/client branching in Studio files.
- Clear build cache and restart.

---

Would you like me to add `'use client'` to your Studio page, or help you check for any other possible sources of mismatch?

Remove the export of 'metadata' and 'viewport' from a client component, as this is not allowed in Next.js. Also, ensure there are no stray characters before the 'use client' directive.

---

The `'use client'` directive has been added to your Studio page, and the forbidden `metadata`/`viewport` exports have been removed. This ensures the Studio page is a proper client component, which is required for Sanity Studio to work correctly in Next.js App Router.

If you still see a linter error about "Unknown word (CssSyntaxError)" on line 1, make sure:
- There are **no blank lines, spaces, or comments before** `'use client';` at the very top of the file.
- The file should start exactly like this:
  ```tsx
  'use client';

  /**
   * This route is responsible for the built-in authoring environment using Sanity Studio.
   * ...
  ```

You can now test your Studio route. This should resolve both the `<noscript>` error and the hydration mismatch.

If you still encounter issues, let me know the exact error and I’ll help you further!
