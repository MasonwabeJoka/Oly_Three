# Verification Flow Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Navigation Issues**
- **Before**: Users couldn't navigate back to user type selection after choosing a type
- **After**: Users can now navigate back to user type selection from any step

### 2. **Enhanced User Type Selection**
- **Visual Feedback**: Added clear indication of currently selected type
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows current step progress when returning to selection
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Warns users before losing progress when changing types
- **Better UI**: Improved design with descriptions and selection states

### 3. **Improved State Management**
- **Data Clearing**: Added `clearUserTypeData()` method to reset verification data when switching types
- **Better Navigation**: Fixed auto-advance logic to prevent unwanted navigation
- **URL Handling**: Proper routing between user type selection and verification steps

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Back Button**: Now shows on all steps except the first (user type selection)
- **Progress Preservation**: Maintains progress within the same user type
- **Clear Visual Cues**: Better indication of current selection and progress

## Key Files Modified

1. **`AccountVerification.tsx`** - Fixed navigation logic and auto-advance behavior
2. **`UserTypeSelection.tsx`** - Enhanced with progress tracking and confirmation dialogs
3. **`UserTypeSelection.module.scss`** - Updated styling for better visual feedback
4. **`VerificationFormWrapper.tsx`** - Enabled back navigation to user type selection
5. **`useVerificationStore.ts`** - Added data clearing and navigation helper methods
6. **`page.tsx`** - Added main entry point for account verification

## User Flow

1. **Entry**: User clicks "Account Verification" from settings
2. **User Type Selection**: User chooses between Individual or Business
3. **Verification Steps**: User proceeds through type-specific verification
4. **Navigation**: User can go back to any previous step, including user type selection
5. **Type Change**: User can change type with confirmation if progress exists

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Fresh Start
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/settings/account-verification/`
2. Should redirect to `/dashboard/settings/account-verification/user-type`
3. Select "Individual" - should show selection feedback
4. Click "Proceed" - should advance to first individual verification step
5. Click "Back" - should return to user type selection with current selection shown

### Test Case 2: Changing User Type
1. Complete user type selection and advance to step 2
2. Navigate back to user type selection
3. Select different type - should show confirmation dialog
4. Confirm change - should reset progress and show new type's first step

### Test Case 3: Browser Navigation
1. Use browser back/forward buttons during verification
2. Navigate directly to URLs like `/dashboard/settings/account-verification/individual/id`
3. Should handle URL changes gracefully and maintain proper state

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users have full control over their verification process
2. **Error Recovery**: Users can easily restart if they make mistakes
3. **Flexibility**: Users can change their mind about verification type
4. **Clear Feedback**: Users always know where they are in the process
5. **Data Safety**: Confirmation before losing progress
