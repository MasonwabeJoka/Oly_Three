# Technical architecture proposal — Sanity-first classifieds app (concrete stacks, integrations, pros/cons)

Nice — here’s a focused, actionable architecture document you can use as a blueprint.
I’ll give **concrete stack recommendations** (Basic vs Best-Practice), **what each system owns**, **how to integrate**, **schemas & sync patterns**, **packages/deps**, and **operational notes** (security, testing, monitoring).

---

# 1 — High-level summary (one-line)

Use **Sanity** as the canonical content store for listings, categories, and editorial content; use **Postgres** for transactional and relational data; use a **Realtime store** (Redis or Supabase Realtime) for live features; use **Algolia / Meilisearch** for search; use **Mux / S3** for heavy media; and record analytics in **ClickHouse/BigQuery**.

---

# 2 — Concrete stacks

## Basic (fast to build, low ops)

- Frontend: **Next.js 14 (App router, TypeScript)**
- Content: **Sanity (Content Lake)**
- Auth: **Clerk** (drop-in)
- Relational DB + Realtime: **Supabase** (Postgres + Realtime)
- Search: **Meilisearch** (self-host or managed)
- Media: **Sanity assets** + **Mux** for video
- Analytics: **Supabase Postgres (event table)** or **PostHog** for product analytics

**When to use:** MVP / regional product, limited traffic, lower engineering budget.

---

## Best Practice (scalable, production-ready)

- Frontend: **Next.js 14 (App router, TypeScript, Server Actions)**
- Content: **Sanity** (source of truth for listings & editorial)
- Auth: **Auth0** or **Clerk** (Auth0 if you need enterprise SSO)
- Transactions / Relational: **Postgres (Neon or AWS RDS / Supabase for managed Postgres)**
- Realtime: **Redis (managed: Upstash / AWS Elasticache) + WebSocket service or use** **Pusher/Ably** for pub/sub; optionally **Supabase Realtime** if you prefer Postgres-based realtime.
- Search: **Algolia** (managed) or **Meilisearch Cloud** (cheaper)
- Media: **Mux** for video streaming + **S3** for attachments; store small images in Sanity if convenient
- Analytics: **ClickHouse** or **BigQuery** (data warehouse)
- Observability: **Sentry** (errors), **Datadog / Grafana + Prometheus** (metrics)

**When to use:** Growing product, multiple regions, high-write features (auctions/chat), stronger SLAs.

---

# 3 — Data ownership (concise)

- **Sanity:** listings content (title, body, images refs), categories, editorial banners, public user profiles.
- **Postgres:** user private data references (IDs), transactions/payments, wallets, bank account metadata (not raw sensitive values), permanent audit logs.
- **Realtime (Redis / Supabase):** live bids, live chat messages (hot store), counters (views, likes) as high-throughput ephemeral data.
- **Search (Algolia/Meilisearch):** index of listing payloads optimized for faceting + geo.
- **Analytics (ClickHouse/BigQuery):** event logs, conversions, ad performance.
- **Media (Mux/S3):** heavy videos / attachments; Sanity stores references to those assets.

---

# 4 — Integration & sync patterns

### Publish flow (Listing create / update)

1. User submits listing (Next.js → Sanity write).
2. Sanity webhook triggers a serverless function (Vercel function, Netlify, or Cloud Run).
3. Serverless function:
   - Indexes/updates document in **Search** (Algolia/Meili).
   - Sends a lightweight record to **Realtime** if you want initial counters or presence.
   - Writes an event to your **Analytics** pipeline (Kafka → ClickHouse / direct ingestion).

**Best practice:** webhook → message queue (e.g., SNS/SQS, Pub/Sub, or Kafka) → workers for indexing, analytics, archiving. That gives resiliency and retries.

---

### Live bidding / auctions

- Auction metadata (start/end, reserve) stored in Sanity (and cached in Postgres).
- Live bids go to **Realtime** (Redis sorted sets or Supabase Realtime rows).
  - Use Redis sorted set per-auction `ZADD` for fast top-bid retrieval.
  - Use optimistic locking on finalization to avoid race conditions.

- When auction ends:
  - Worker reads final bid from Realtime, writes canonical result to **Postgres** (transactionally), triggers payment flow (Stripe/Paystack), writes final status back to **Sanity** and **Search** (sold flag).

**Note:** Do not try to write each bid into Sanity. Archive final results only.

---

### Messaging (buyer ↔ seller)

- Keep messages in **Realtime** store for speed; optionally persist to **Postgres** for long-term archive and moderation.
- For moderation/compliance: copy messages to a moderation queue (e.g., SQS) and process with ML tools or human reviewers.

---

### Counters (views/likes/favorites)

- Use Redis counters incrementing in-memory with periodic batch writes to Postgres/analytics for persistence/aggregation (e.g., every 5–15 minutes or on thresholds).
- Show near-real-time values using Realtime subscriptions; use eventual batch sync for Sanity-only displays (e.g., show aggregated views on listing).

# 6 — Recommended packages & dependencies

### Frontend (Next.js)

- `@sanity/client` or `@sanity/preview-kit` (to fetch content)
- `swr` or `@tanstack/react-query` (data fetching/caching)
- `zustand` (state) — you already use it
- `next-video` / `mux` packages for videos
- `meilisearch` client

### Backend / Serverless workers

- `pg` / `knex` / `drizzle-orm` / `prisma` (Postgres) — I recommend **Prisma** for DX and migrations.
- `ioredis` (Redis)
- `bullmq` or `bee-queue` (job queue for workers) — optionally use cloud queue (SQS).
- `stripe` / `@paystack/inline` (payments)
- `algoliasearch` / `meilisearch` client for indexing
- `axios` / native fetch for calling Sanity/webhooks

### Observability & infra

- `sentry/node` or `@sentry/nextjs`
- Prometheus exporters or cloud metrics integrations
- `winston` or `pino` for logs

---

# 7 — Security & compliance

- **Never** store raw payment card details in your systems — use Stripe or Paystack tokenization.
- Keep **sensitive data** (bank account numbers, IDs) in **encrypted columns** in Postgres or in a vault (AWS KMS encrypt). Only store references in Sanity.
- Enforce **RBAC** in Sanity (editors vs admins) and in Auth provider for actions (seller, buyer, admin).
- Use HTTPS everywhere, rotate API keys, use short-lived tokens for serverless-to-serverless communication.
- For PII/data retention, define retention policy and implement archive+deletion workers.

---

# 8 — Operational concerns: deployments, backups, scaling

- **Deployment:** Vercel for Next.js; serverless functions for webhooks/cron; workers on Cloud Run / ECS / Fly / Heroku.
- **Database backups:** automated daily snapshots for Postgres; point-in-time recovery for critical DB.
- **Redis:** use managed (Upstash/Elasticache) to avoid ops burden.
- **Search index sync:** design idempotent sync (upsert by `sanity_id`), and keep a reconciliation job running daily to find inconsistencies.
- **Scaling live features:** scale Redis & websocket nodes horizontally; consider sharding by auction id or region.

---

# 9 — Testing & release strategy

- **Unit tests:** Prisma models, indexing jobs, webhook handlers.
- **Integration tests:** End-to-end publish → webhook → search index flow (use a staging Sanity dataset).
- **Load testing:** auctions & chat paths (k6, Locust). Validate Redis and Postgres behavior under concurrent writes.
- **Feature flags:** Launch auctions, chat, and payments behind flags (e.g., `launch_auctions`) to limit blast radius.

---

# 10 — Cost & trade-offs (short)

- **Sanity**: predictable for content; costs grow with asset size & number of reads.
- **Algolia**: great UX but expensive at scale; Meili is cheaper but requires ops.
- **Redis & Postgres**: moderate cost; scale with usage.
- **ClickHouse / BigQuery**: cost effective for analytics at high volume.
- **Mux**: cost for video ingest+egress; but best UX.

---

# 11 — Onboarding & migration plan (if you have existing data)

1. Export existing listings into a staging Sanity dataset.
2. Create `sanity_id` ↔ `postgres.listings_meta` mapping table during migration.
3. Index all listings to search (bulk import).
4. Replay counters/analytics into analytics DB (if available).
5. Run reconciliation jobs and fix mismatches.

---

# 12 — Quick implementation checklist (first 30 days)

1. Scaffold Next.js + Sanity schema for `listing`, `category`, `publicUser`.
2. Integrate Clerk or Auth0 for signup/login and get user IDs.
3. Add `listings_meta` table in Postgres; copy minimal listing references on publish.
4. Add Sanity webhook + serverless function that upserts into Search (Algolia/Meili).
5. Implement Redis-based view counter + a worker to batch persist to Postgres.
6. Implement payments flow (Stripe/Paystack) & `transactions` table in Postgres.
7. Add basic monitoring: Sentry + metrics for webhook failures.
8. Write integration tests for listing creation -> search index.

---

# 13 — Example patterns & snippets (high-level)

### Webhook handler (pseudo)

- Receive Sanity webhook -> validate signature -> push to queue (SQS/Kafka) -> worker consumes -> upserts to Search -> emits analytics event.

### Auction finalize (pseudo)

- Cron or scheduled job checks auction end times -> atomically read top bid from Redis -> create transaction in Postgres inside a DB transaction -> trigger payment capture -> update Sanity via API to `status: sold`.

---

# 14 — Next steps I can do for you (pick any)

- Produce a **detailed ERD** (Postgres schema) for users/transactions/auctions.
- Write a **Sanity schema set** for listings + categories + publicUser.
- Create the **webhook + worker** code (indexing to Algolia/Meili) — full code ready to paste.
- Implement a **Redis-based auction prototype** with Node.js sample code.
- Create CI/CD templates (GitHub Actions) for tests, deploy, and migrations.

Tell me which of the next steps you want and I’ll produce it (I can provide code, config, and example infra manifests).
